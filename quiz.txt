Between these two code snippets, the first one offers a more optimized approach. 
By attaching the event listener to a common parent element, it reduces the memory footprint, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with potentially large arrays.

In contrast, the second snippet assigns an individual event listener to each item in the list, which could burden performance as the number of array elements increases.

In conclusion, with performance optimization and ease of maintenance in mind, the first code snippet represents a more appropriate implementation.
